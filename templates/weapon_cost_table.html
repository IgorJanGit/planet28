        <h3>About Weapon Special Rule Costs</h3>
        <p>When creating custom weapons, you can add these special rules to adjust the weapon's capabilities. Each rule has an associated cost modifier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive cost (+) makes the weapon more expensive</li>
            <li>Negative cost (-) makes the weapon less expensive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The total cost of all special rules should be added to the base weapon cost.</p>
