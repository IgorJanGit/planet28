    <h1>Planet 28 Warband Creation Rules</h1>
    <div class="section-title">Background</div>
    <p>The starting point for every character is their background. This should inform how you assign skills, traits, and abilities to each individual in your warband. Think of a backstory for each of your characters—who are they, why are they part of this warband, what are their strengths and weaknesses?</p>
    <div class="section-title">Points</div>
    <p>Characters in Planet 28 are built using a points system. 500 points is a good starting warband size for most games, but feel free to change this if you want bigger or smaller games. Each new character has a starting cost of 10 points to add to your warband. Unless stated otherwise, your warband must include at least 2 characters.</p>
    <div class="section-title">Skills</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Each character’s core skills (Agility, Fighting, Shooting, Awareness, Psyche) start at 1.</li>
        <li>You can increase a skill by 1 for a cost of 10 points (e.g., increasing a skill from 1 to 5 costs 40 points).</li>
        <li>Skills cannot be greater than 10 or lower than 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section-title">Hit-points</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Every character starts with 20 hit-points.</li>
        <li>Increase hit-points by 2 for 10 points, or decrease by 2 for -10 points.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section-title">Speed</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Every character starts with a speed of 10cm. Speed cannot be changed with points.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section-title">Traits</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Traits alter the way characters do things, impact core skills, or provide benefits/hindrances.</li>
        <li>Add traits for the points cost listed in the traits table. Some traits have negative points value.</li>
        <li>No limit on the number of traits per character, but more traits = higher cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section-title">Abilities</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Abilities are unique actions a character can perform. Each has a points cost listed in the abilities table.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section-title">Equipment</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Equipment includes weapons, armour, ammunition, and other items.</li>
        <li>Each piece of equipment has a price in credits. When building your warband, you can spend points as credits (1:1).</li>
        <li>After creation, you must use credits to buy equipment.</li>
        <li>Leftover points can be exchanged for credits at the same rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="rule-note">Credits and points may seem the same, but there may be times when your warband earns one and not the other, and you never know when you might run out of cash!</div>
